title: About Clemens Novak
---

My name is Clemens Novak and I am interested in a variety of topics:
mathematics, telecommunications, computers, programming... I have studied
electrical engineering and are working in industry since 2010.

So far I have used different methods for keeping my notes (paper, chaotic
source code files on my computer...). This website is my first experiment with
organizing my notes in a blog.
